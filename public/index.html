      <strong>
         QUETTA: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf central parliamentary <br> board, headed by Prime Minister Imran
         Khan, has withdrawn the <br> party ticket awarded to business tycoon Abdul Qadir in Balochistan <br> for the
         Senate election after strong opposition from the PTI <br> provincial leadership and zonal heads.
      </strong>
   </p>
   <p class="imp">
      The party high command decided to take back ticket from Abdul Qadir and <br> nominated Zahoor Agha for the Senate
      election on a general seat, said Adviser <br> to the Prime Minister Shahbaz Gill on Saturday. “Withdrawal of party
      ticket <br> from Abdul Qadir is correct,” the adviser said, explaining that Mr Agha would <br> be party candidate
      from
      Balochistan in the Senate election.
   </p>
   <p class="imp">
      Opposing the award of party ticket to Abdul Qadir, PTI’s provincial leadership <br> argued that he did not belong
      to
      the PTI as he had been a member of the <br> ruling Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) till last week.
   </p>
   <p class="imp">
      The party provincial spokesman Asif Tareen also confirmed to Dawn that <br> Zahoor Agha would contest the Senate
      election on general seat from <br> Balochistan as the party withdrew its ticket from Mr Qadir.
   </p>
   <p class="imp">
      He said the previous decision of the PTI had been taken in Islamabad without <br> even consulting the Balochistan
      leadership of the party.
   </p>
   <p class="imp">
      PTI regional presidents Dr Munir Baloch, Nawab Khan Dummar, Taj <br> Mohammad Rind, Waris Dashti and provincial
      leaders
      Bismillah Agha and <br> Babar Yousafzai earlier told a joint press conference that according to the <br> PTI’s
      manifesto
      only a party member could contest Senate election.
   </p>
   <p class="imp">
      Calling Mr Qadir a ‘parachuter’, the PTI leaders said the ticket had been <br> awarded to a person who had nothing
      to
      do with the party. They demanded <br> immediate withdrawal of the party ticket from him and an investigation to
      <br>
      ascertain who had introduced him to Prime Minister Imran Khan and <br> supported his name for party ticket. They
      said
      Abdul Qadir had been a partner <br> of Shehbaz Sharif (president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz) and <br>
      facing
      National Accountability Bureau cases.
   </p>
   <p class="imp">
      Meanwhile, Mr Qadir, who has already filed his nomination papers with the <br> certificate of party ticket with
      the
      returning officer in Quetta, has been quoted <br> by a private TV channel as saying: “I accept the decision of the
      party <br> leadership about withdrawal of party ticket.”
